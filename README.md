## Setup

You need to set your TV to use a pre-shared key.

1. Navigate to: [Settings] → [Network] → [Home Network Setup] → [IP Control]
2. Set [Authentication] to [Normal and Pre-Shared Key]
3. There should be a new menu entry [Pre-Shared Key]. Set it to a 4 digit value (e.g. **0000**).

## Usage

1. Run `print_ircc_codes.sh TV_IP_HERE` to get an overview of the commands possible.
2. Run `send_command.sh TV_IP_HERE TC_PIN_HERE ONE_COMMAND_HERE`. A command looks like `AAAAAQAAAAEAAABgAw==`.
3. The TV will execute the command and immediately return. If you want to navigate through menus, you'll have to manually `sleep` until the TV has finished the command/animation.

See `example_goto_media_player.sh` on how to build your automations.

Have fun!
